## Paul’s Change of Plans
>”But I call God to witness against me-it was to spare you that I refrained from coming again to Corinth. Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, for you stand firm in your faith. For I made up my mind not to make another painful visit to you. For if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained? And I wrote as I did, so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice, for I felt sure of all of you, that my joy would be the joy of you all. For I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart, and with many tears, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.” (2 Corinthians 1:23-2:4; ESV)

As I read how Paul told the Corinthians that they were his joy and that he would not bring a harmful presence to them, I found myself cringing. I felt judgmental that Paul needed better boundaries if he couldn’t go see those Corinthians without hurting them. What popped in my head was, “Is Paul a codependent?”

Codependency was the main issue, apart from drug and alcohol addiction, I dealt with my therapist soon after she met me in the Children’s hospital in Oakland. My therapist explained that I was too enmeshed with my family’s expectations, so I became obsessed with making them happy. I had to learn how to face the shame and guilt of disappointing them without losing my self-esteem. She gave me a book titled “The New Codependency,” in which Melody Beattie taught me to pray “God help us to forgive them, them to forgive us, and us to forgive ourselves. Please God. Thank you God.” So, I ran to the cross and identified with the life, death, and resurrection of my Lord Jesus Christ.

Now with more experience in recovery, I found myself questioning whether or not it was sin for me to identify as a codependent. If I stick with my own definition of it as doing something for someone to make them happy, even if it hurts myself, then isn’t that what Christ did? For I see my Savior on the cross, and I drink a cup of his blood, shed for my salvation. By his wounds, I am healed and made happy. If I am to imitate my Lord Jesus in bearing my cross, then how dare I call upon the name of codependency to refuse service? After revisiting Beattie’s book, I realized that she explained that codependency is normal behavior, until it crosses the boundary. If being on the right side of codependent is interdependent, then my pride against my own codependency is starving me of meaningful relationships. I must die to my pride and hope for a life where I can suffer for the sake of his name, to be in his presence.

I am called by God to love my neighbor, as myself. I would not want somebody to hurt themselves to serve me, therefore, it must matter when I am hurt when serving others. I thank God that I was granted repentance of a life of self-sufficiency or extreme codependency. Through Christ, I have gained access to the Father and his kingdom. Now that I have Jesus, I have found dependence on man to be lacking; this is because I get my spiritual needs met through constant contact with his Body—the people of God. When a brother serves me, they are yoked to Christ, so our shared burden is light. When I serve and suffer, I no longer serve and suffer alone. The Spirit works through me, as long as I do his will. Apart from his will, I must say “no,” for that person needs a “yes” from God.

Yes, I should be selfless towards my family. I must not shy away from a chance to be of service to them, for it is by this act of worship where they may see Christ in me. But no, I shouldn’t denounce Christ to please them. Yet, I can suffer and rejoice alongside them out of my abundant love for them. For I have received so much love from God through his Son. And by the power of the Spirit, I can control my willingness to serve, as far as it glorifies God.
