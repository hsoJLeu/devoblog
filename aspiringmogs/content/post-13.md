>“Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; but his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night. He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers.” (Psalms 1:1-3; ESV)

After my hardware removal surgery at Stanford hospital in 2017, I stayed there for a day and was taken care of by a Filipino male nurse. He walked in on me while I was reading my bible. He expressed how excited he was to see my faith, and he randomly asked me if I had memorized Psalms 1. I quickly flip to it while he recited it to me at my bedside. He told me to memorize it, laid hands on me, and prayed for me. After he left, I tested myself on how much I memorized, and to my delight, I had most of it. I reread, closed the book, and tested myself until I got the rest. I still remember that day vividly because of how shocked I was at his openness and my memory.

Through memorizing it, I’ve learned to appreciate the art within this psalm. It draws a picture of the godly and the ungodly. The righteous man walks before God and disregards the influences of sin by delighting in the law of God. My faith has made me righteous, yet the way I walk, stand, and sit needs training to reflect that truth. Aided by God, I charge into new territory through meditation. By setting my mind to love God and my neighbor, I see how good it is to delight on his law. By the spirit of the law, God aligns my will to his will.

In verse 3, we find a godly tree planted by streams of water. The action of planting alludes to the nature of the gospel. To us, Jesus is living water that proclaims salvation to us. By his grace, we receive the Holy Spirit, who bears witness to us, who then bears fruits of the Spirit, blessings to those around us. In reference to seasons, I interpret this as God’s timing. We have assurance of his salvation, but the process of sanctification takes time. As followers of Jesus, we must accept the pace that he sets. Naturally, a tree comes around to Fall, but the next verse says the godly tree does not wither. This implies an evergreen state of full satisfaction; every need met. It is eternal life we are promised after Jesus said not a hair on our heads would perish though we are hated (Luke 21:17-18). When reading the next line about prospering in all we do, I find God inviting me to dare be holy. How hard this verse must have been to believe for Israel to hear, yet it is not impossible for those who are saved.  If this verse is predicated on walking according to his will and his way, then the path I see he will prosper me in is towards holiness and righteousness. And this makes sense alongside 2 Timothy 3:16-17: “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the mans of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.”
