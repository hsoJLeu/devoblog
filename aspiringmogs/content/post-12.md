# Job 1

>“Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil?” Job 1:8

I’ve been meaning to write about this particular chapter ever since I heard the news about my mom being readmitted to a psychiatric hospital. In this book, as we all may know, there’s a man named Job who’s blameless, upright, and fears God. He’s blessed with great possessions and wealth and “was the greatest of all the people of the east” (V3). He ends up losing much of his wealth and possessions through testing, goes through a period of lament, but is ultimately blessed even further at the end of the book. The particular phrase “blameless and upright” has been used in reference to Noah and Abraham and we know how God treated and blessed those individuals. Job is a man of God, one who fears the Lord and is faithful.

From verses 6-16, we read more about this gathering of heavenly beings (commentary on what “sons of God” may be) before the Lord. It just so happens that Satan stops by and tells God that he’s come “from going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it” (V7). It isn’t really clear how and why Satan comes along, but he isn’t part of the “sons of God” and seems to have just tagged along.

Now what’s interesting to me is that after Satan answers God’s question in verse 7, God replies, “Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil?” (V8). We all know that God knows all things and he knows what he’s doing, but in this particular moment, it’s almost as if God was giving Satan a “target”, if you will, to test. It’s interesting that there isn’t any further interrogation of why Satan has come to this gathering, especially if this gathering was  potentially intended to be with only heavenly beings and God. Satan’s response to God’s question shows his craftiness. Think about the garden with Adam and Eve. The serpent was incredibly crafty and deceptive in the way he tempts them. Here in verses 9-11, Satan is basically saying how Job only praises God because of his prosperity and possessions. He doubts the sincerity of Job’s faith and believes that if it’s all taken away, Job will curse God.

Verse 12 is unique because it shows God’s authority in his response to Satan. “Behold, all that he has is in your hand…” Satan had to ask God for permission to test Job. This is powerful to us as readers because God is sovereign over everyone and everything, including Satan. Nothing can separate us from Christ’s love and we are more than conquerors through him (Romans 8).

In the succeeding verses (13-19), we see Satan basically taking away Job’s property and children. Messengers manage to escape to tell Job the terrible things that happen. I find it interesting that these messengers were able to escape from the tragedies. What if Job didn’t hear about these calamities from these messengers and found out himself? Would he still exhibit the persistent faithfulness and uprightness he’s been known to have? I believe he would’ve praised the Lord regardless of how he found out because of the heart that God gave him.

The last few verses (20-22) really struck a chord, particularly because of my mother’s situation. Job, a man who’s been blameless and upright, loses his property and children (and eventually more) because God allowed Satan to test him. Job has every right to be upset, confused and  frustrated. He has every right to curse God! But what is his response? He “tore his robe and shaved his head and fell on the ground and worshipped…The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord” (V20-21). His response is one of grief and sorrow which is understandable in light of what just happened. But I like to interpret it as one of humility, surrender, and worship unto the Lord. Job gave praise to God for what happened. He didn’t curse God. He didn’t turn away from God. Instead, his fear of the Lord remained strong and he turned away from doing any evil. “In all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrong” (V22). Wow, what a response.

Now my mother’s situation may not be on the scale of Job’s situation but I felt that I lost a huge part of my life with my mom’s new reality. I wept and I was sorrowful. I think there was a certain point where I wanted to blame God and complain how it simply wasn’t fair for any of this to happen. But one morning, God told me to read the first chapter of Job and God has once again reminded me of who’s in control. If I really do believe that God is sovereign and in control of everything, then that should prompt a response of worship and praise because it’s what he deserves. My response to my mother’s situation should have been one of praise, but instead it was one of disappointment and doubt.

We may look at ourselves and think that we aren’t like Job. We’re not blameless and upright and we don’t fear God and turn away from evil. I felt that way. I do not compare to someone as faithful as Job. But as I reflect upon it some more, I am convinced that I can be as blameless, upright, and faithful as Job (and potentially more) solely because of Jesus Christ. No matter what negative circumstance or situation comes, I can respond in a way that gives honor and glory to God because of the power of Christ in me.

Endless praise. I pray the Holy Spirit may lead me to respond in that way to any and every situation.
