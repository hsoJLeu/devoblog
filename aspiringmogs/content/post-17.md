So, I’ve been having some major writer’s block and been stuck on 1 Corinthians 2 for the past couple weeks. But recent events have gotten me thinking quite a bit, and I wanted to write some of my thoughts down. I think I’ll divide them and post sporadically as I finish writing them up.

***

This past week, one of my pastors asked me if I had any regrets about coming to Turkey. I understand his good intent; I understand the concern that provoked the inquiry. But I hate the question. I hate it because it *seems* synonymous with “Do you think you wasted your time in Turkey?” I hate it because I know it is a question I will hear in abundance when I return home. I hate it because a part of me believes the answer is “Yes”.

In modern American culture, there a few--if any--things more important than **efficiency**. If someone is caught doing something in a suboptimal manner, they are jeered and berated by online comments. If we make a purchase, and later find out there was a better deal for the same item, we feel as if we had somehow *lost* the money we could have saved. “Work smarter, not harder,” has become the mantra of modern American culture.

And it is this American ideal that begets my inner turmoil. The efficiency-loving American in me feels as if this time in Turkey has been a waste. For what has come of it? Has any benefit come to my career or success? Did I gain any acclaim or achievement to add to my resume or curriculum vitae? Since graduate school didn’t work, I must have surely squandered this past year. But efficiency is an American virtue, not a Christian one. That isn’t to say that Christians should disregard efficiency, especially in administrative and logistical matters. But, frankly, I do not believe in the human capacity to discern “effectiveness”--that is, to distinguish what is efficient and what is not--when it comes to winning souls. To man’s hand, the heart is as tough and obstinate as diamond; the heart is malleable only in God’s hands. As such, there is nothing for the Christian to do except give his best efforts. To the Christian, working smarter and working harder are nigh synonymous, because we are not smart enough to streamline the work of winning souls.

But there is still an ultimate conviction, and an ultimate comfort, that was impressed upon my heart through the conversation with my pastor. When determining the value of a purchase, what do we consider? We compare the item that is purchased with the price that was paid. When considering a purchase of a car, we regard the specifications of the car itself and then decide whether or not the amount paid is appropriate. But at the extremes, the condition of the car can render the price utterly inconsequential to the determination of a “good” or “bad” purchase. For example, if a car is so terrible that it can only be brought to a scrapyard, then no price, no matter how low, would make it worth the trouble; the car is *worthless*. On the other hand, if a car is so wonderful, then no payment would be too large to consider; the car is *priceless*.

Do we not consider the use of our time in a similar manner? When we are able to spend our time on things that are important and/or meaningful to us, then we consider such activities to be good uses of our time. But when we find ourselves spending our time on things irrelevant or unbeneficial to our interests, we are troubled by the prospect of “wasting” our time. In that case, I challenge you to think of something--on which we can spend our time--of greater value, importance, or meaning, than God. If we are giving our time to the Lord, then how can such time *ever* be considered a waste? Because would not God be the very one giving that time its value?

But we can take this a step further. The pursuit of efficiency begets a certain fear of comparison. When we buy a new laptop, we dread the possibility of a better deal existing that we may have missed. When a friend stumbles upon a great find on Craigslist or Facebook marketplace, how often are we able to feel genuine happiness, instead of envy? The distaste for wasting time comes from the idea that our time could be spent better elsewhere. In that case, on what could our time be better spent than on God? If God is of supreme value, which I attest to be true, then spending our time on God is the best possible use of our time. If this is true, when we spend our time on *anything* else, should not this be considered a waste of our time in comparison? Why would we spend time mining for silver when an opportunity for gold exists? Likewise, why would we give our time and effort to things less than God? In a strange, ironic way, the American idealism of efficiency--and consequential fear of inefficiency--could be our greatest motivation for living for the Lord. The comfort for the American Christian is that giving our time to the the Lord is always the optimal route--and *never* a waste.
