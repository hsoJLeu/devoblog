## Luke 9:57-58

>"As they were going along the road, someone said to him, 'I will follow you wherever you go.'' And Jesus said to him, 'Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.'"

This reading is set after the transfiguration on the mountain. Jesus trudged along the road to Jeruselam, where knew he must suffer. On the way there, he healed people of unclean spirits. He sent his disciples to scout a Samaritan village, but they rejected Jesus "because his face was set toward Jerusalem." (v.53) These Samaritans practiced some pagan-Jewish hybrid religion, as a result of mixed marriages from the days of captivity. Their prejudice against Christ's journey to Jerusalem denied themselves the pleasure of dwelling with the "I am." (John 8:58)

In our reading, the newcomer must have witnessed Christ's healing, "astonished at the majesty of God."(v.43) He wanted to follow Jesus, so how did Jesus respond? The text doesn't say Jesus rebuked him, as he did to his disciples, hell-bound on punishing the Samaritans. (v.54-55) Rather, he used his current situation to show the truth about himself. He mercifully faced rejection, not even accepted by people who are so open-minded as to mixing Judaism and paganism. It's as if Jesus refused to lead people on with false advertising. He didn't want people mislead by supernatural signs from God. *Yes, he has authority to heal, but before being exalted, he must first suffer.* He responded to these people in the most loving way possible. He told them to truth, informing them and inviting them into his way of life.

I can learn so much from the way Jesus chose his words: no self-righteous pomp of being the best nor ecstatic zeal to take on another follower. He simply laid out the hard truth to challenge the man's decision. He could have discouraged the man by personally attacking this newcomer's inability to be true to his word, but he kept it about the cross he himself bears. The man must be okay with living in Jesus's footsteps, even if he is homeless. After seeing, thus believing, God's will through Jesus, the man had to make a decision to turn his will over to the care of God, even if he is homeless.

Growing up, my greatest motivator was fear. I did what my Dad said because of fear. I did what my Mom said because of fear. They threatened to hit me, take away my gameboy, send me to Africa, etc. My fear of pain, and of loss, and of hunger drove me to be obedient. This worked as long as I still feared that it could be true. However, my fears of these threats being true went away as I grew up; I was larger and smarter, but worst of all, I learned how to appease them. I spent my youth figuring out how to "save" my life.

This backfired when I was supposed to make my own decisions. Any question relating to who I wanted to be baffled me. I was shocked to find out that others were able to make decisions about their life. I only cared about myself, yet I couldn't care for myself, not knowing what it means to live a life worth living. These negative emotions of fear, envy, anger, confusion, and self-pity lead to one more drink, one more smoke, and one more striving after the wind.

It wasn't until I learned about Christ through discipleship, that I saw the truth: "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself?" (v.23-25) Jesus said this implying that there is something more valuable than the whole world: losing my life for his sake.

As I went through high school and college, I felt such a burden to perform well out of a fear of becoming homeless. My train of thought went like this: if I don't do well on this, then I will fail the class, then I might not be able to get this degree, then I might not have a degree, then my parents will be mad at me, then they will kick me out, and I will be homeless. I could ace a class on becoming the victim of my circumstances, but I could not take my education seriously. I felt like I was forced to study. I lived for the flesh, the world, and the devil.

But Jesus in our passage shows us a different way to live. I see now that though other people may have better degrees, girlfriends, families, and jobs than me, I am secure because I made a decision to turn my will and my life over to the care of God. Even if Satan tempts me with fear about people, places, and things, I don't need to fear. I am baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit cries out "Abba, Father" as I remember the love of God, in his amazing grace through Jesus Christ, covers me. I am his Beloved, a new creation he has redeemed out of his abundant mercy. If he is able to resurrect his Son from the grave, I believe he has power to rescue sinners from spiritual death.

To combat the flesh, I fast regularly, even during Easter, as to resist that deep-seated fear of pain. I trust in God to feed me daily bread by carving out time for daily office, morning and evening. To combat the world, I actively take inventory of myself and make amends as to grow in much-needed humility. As I clean house, I am reminded of how I have no hope of praying to God without Jesus. To combat the devil, I try to help others. Rather than to be eaten alive by self-centered fear, I seek out suffering people to comfort, understand, and/or love. As I center myself around others, I grow in likeness to the Son, who gave himself for the world. My fellowship grows, and divisions amongst race, religion, culture, and sex vanish. When I'm rejected, I forgive, relinquishing my will to punish. The grace of God means that I have faith, even if my worst fears are coming true.
