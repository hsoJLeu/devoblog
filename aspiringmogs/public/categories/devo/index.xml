      <description>Matthew 19:16-30  There is a fatal snare in the initial question, “What good deed must I do to have eternal life?” (verse 16) The response elucidates the question’s error: “Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good.” (verse 17) We cannot make the mistake of assuming that our salvation is dependent upon our deeds. Here, Christ is hinting that salvation, goodness, is dependent upon the Lord, whom if the man had a relationship with, he would not have needed to ask the question.</description>
